# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing

# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)

  # must be at least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will
  # fall back to the window manager's recommended size.

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.

  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background and no title bar buttons
  decorations: none

  # Background opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
